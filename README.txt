The code is a bit incomprehensible in some areas and others contain comments referring the the original that I copied the format from.
I'll try to annotate things properly later so that we can better understand what's happening and so that it becomes less of a plagiaristic act.

The use of multiple player fxml files is just a temporary workaround. I wasn't able to change the label text very easily, but I'll keep looking into it.

If you wish to experiment with style sheets, replace (or use) the vista.css file. If you use a different file change the call to vista.css in Main.java's createScene().

In case any of you would like to see where I adapted this from: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18619394/loading-new-fxml-in-the-same-scene
